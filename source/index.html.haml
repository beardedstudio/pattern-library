  %section.primary
    %h3.section-title Headings
    %p Headings briefly describe the information below them. They are hierarchical and can be nested, implying both relative importance and dependency. This means that an <code>h1</code> will always be more important on a page than an  <code>h2</code> in its section. It also means that if an <code>h2</code> is beneath an <code>h1</code> in the DOM, then it is implied that its content has to do with the <code>h1</code>'s content.
    %p Any heading style can be applied to any other heading (or any other element) using the appropriate heading Sass mixin.
    %h1 This is an example of an h1
    %p The <code>h1</code> element is only used on the site for the site name.
